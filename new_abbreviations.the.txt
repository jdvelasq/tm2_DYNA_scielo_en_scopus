    attitudinal and socio ECONOMIC_FACTORS that determine FARMERS ' WILLINGNESS_TO_PAY ( WTP )
    THE_OBJECTIVE of THIS_ARTICLE is to explore THE_FACTORS that are associated with the WILLINGNESS_TO_PAY ( WTP )
    THE_VALUATION_METHOD used was THE_CONTINGENT_VALUATION , through THE_ESTIMATION of the WILLINGNESS_TO_PAY ( WTP )

    THE_CLASSIC_QUESTION from WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_PLANT ( WWTP )
    BIOMASS was taken from AN_ANAEROBIC_WASTE_WATER_TREATMENT_PLANT ( WWTP )
    THIS_COMPOUND is PRESENT in SLUDGE of WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_PLANTS ( WWTPS )
    MEDIUM_AND_LONG_TERM_SCENARIOS , with THE_OPERATION of THE_NEW_WATER_WASTE_TREATMENT_PLANT ( WWTP )
    in THIS_PAPER , we studied ENERGY_RECOVERY from ANAEROBIC_DIGESTION of SEWAGE_SLUDGE in WASTE_WATER_TREATMENT_PLANTS ( WWTP )
    THE_OBJECTIVE of THIS_STUDY was to analyze THE_POTENTIAL_USE of THE_SEWAGE_SLUDGE_BIOCHAR obtained from THE_WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_PLANT ( WWTP )
    this WORK_EVALUATES THE_PHOTODEGRADATION of ORGANIC , inorganic OXIDIZABLE_COMPOUNDS and THE_INACTIVATION of MICROORGANISMS in MUNICIPAL_WASTEWATER , from THE_EFLUENT of A_WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_PLANT ( WWTP )
    finally , FOUR_SCENARIOS were simulated , from which it was determined that in ORDER to achieve THE_ENVIRONMENTAL_OBJECTIVES it is necessary to improve THE_PROCESSES of MANCHAY_AND_SAN_BARTOLO_WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_PLANTS ( WWTPS )
    this allows not only to determine THE_RESIDENT and FLOATING_POPULATION of A_REGION , but also to select and delimit SPECIFIC_AREAS , to obtain THE_POPULATION_DATA to be served in A_SECTOR , defining VOLUMES of WATER , NETWORKS , WATER_TREATMENT_PLANTS , SIZE of DRAINS and SANITARY_DISCHARGES , as well as SIZING WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_PLANTS ( WWTP )
