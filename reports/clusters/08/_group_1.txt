AB background : BEER is THE_MOST_CONSUMED_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE globally , and
   THE_DEMAND for DIFFERENTIATED_BEERS with PECULIAR_CHARACTERISTICS has
   intensified among BEER_CONSUMERS , creating A_SIGNIFICANT_MARKET_NICHE . in
   this study , we developed A_LOW_ALCOHOL_LIGHT_CRAFT_BEER enriched with
   OLIVE_LEAF_EXTRACT ( OLEA_EUROPAEA_L . ) . THE_COLD_MASHING_TECHNIQUE
   associated with INTERRUPTED_FERMENTATION was used in THE_MASHING_STEP .
   DIFFERENT_CONCENTRATIONS of OLIVE_LEAF_EXTRACT ( 0.5.1.0 and 2.0 % ) were
   added at THE_MATURATION_STAGE . THE_SAMPLES were characterized by
   PHYSICOCHEMICAL_PARAMETERS , PHENOLIC_AND_POLYPHENOLIC_CONTENT ,
   BIOACTIVE_COMPOUNDS , ANTIOXIDANT_POTENTIAL , and MICROBIOLOGICAL_QUALITY .
   results : THE_COLD_MASH_TECHNIQUE associated with INTERRUPTED_FERMENTATION
   provided A_LOW_ALCOHOL_BEER ( 1.3 % ) . the BITTERNESS_DIMENSION ( 19.0 to
   23.2 ibu ) and COLOR ( 917 ebc ) PARAMETER were in accordance with
   THE_BEER_JUDGE_CERTIFICATION_PROGRAM ( BJCP ) for
   THE_AMERICAN_BLOND_ALE_STYLE . THE_ADDITION of THE_EXTRACT enriched
   THE_CONTENT of TOTAL_PHENOLICS ( 171.09 to 437.4 MG_GAE_ML ) and
   polyphenolic ( 221.4 to 729.0 MG_L ) . coumaric , ferulic , and
   CINNAMIC_PHENOLIC_ACIDS were detected in APPRECIABLE_AMOUNTS in THE_BEERS .
   OLEUROPEIN was THE_MAJOR_COMPOUND in THE_BEVERAGE_AND_PLANT_EXTRACT . after
   adding 2 % extract , THE_ABTS and DPPH_RADICAL_SCAVENGING_ACTIVITY ,
   as_well_as THE_FERRIC_REDUCTION_POWER , increased in BEERS by 28.4 % , 449.1
   % , and 120.5 % , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : THE_EXTRACT of o . EUROPAEA_L
   . promoted THE_ENRICHMENT of LOW_ALCOHOL_BEER_SAMPLES with
   BIOACTIVE_COMPOUNDS and ANTIOXIDANT_POTENTIAL . THE_RESULTS obtained
