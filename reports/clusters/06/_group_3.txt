AB background : it has been reported that CIRCULAR_RNA_FORMIN 2 ( circfmn2 )
   can MOTIVATE_COLORECTAL_CANCER_PROLIFERATION . however , THE_EFFECT of
   circfmn2 on THE_POLARIZATION of TUMOR_ASSOCIATED_MACROPHAGES ( TAMS ) in
   THE_CRC_TUMOR_MICROENVIRONMENT remains unclear . the study was to figure out
   THE_LATENT_MECHANISM by which circfmn2 impacts TAM_POLARIZATION to motivate
   THE_MALIGNANT_BEHAVIOR of CRC_CELLS . results : circfmn2 and pik3r3 levels
   were reduced in m1 MACROPHAGES but elevated in m2 MACROPHAGES , WHEREAS_MIR
   150 5p level was THE_OPPOSITE . circfmn2 KNOCKDOWN downregulated m2
   MACROPHAGE markers cd163 , ccl22 and cd206 and upregulated m1 MACROPHAGE
   markers cd86 , tnf and IL 1 in m2 MACROPHAGES . CO_CULTURE with m2
   MACROPHAGE conditioned MEDIUM with circfmn2 KNOCKDOWN reduced
   CRC_PROLIFERATION , INVASION , and MIGRATION , while KNOCKDOWN of mir 150 5p
   had THE_OPPOSITE_EFFECT . circfmn2 adsorbed mir 150 5p to mediate pik3r3 in
   m2 MACROPHAGES . OVEREXPRESSION of mir 150 5p can reverse
   THE_PROMOTING_EFFECTS of OVEREXPRESSION of circfmn2 on m2 POLARIZATION ,
   CRC_CELL_PROLIFERATION , INVASION , and MIGRATION . ELEVATION of pik3r3
   could turn around THE_REPRESSIVE_EFFECT of circfmn2 KNOCKDOWN on m2
   POLARIZATION and CRC_CELL_PROLIFERATION , INVASION , and MIGRATION . in
   AN_IN_VIVO_MODEL , m2 MACROPHAGES expressing LOW or high circfmn2 were CO
   transplanted with CRC_CELLS into NUDE_MICE , resulting_in INHIBITION and
   PROMOTION of TUMOR_GROWTH , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : all_in_all ,
   circfmn2 mediates TAM_POLARIZATION to m2 type by controlling the mir 150 5p
   pik3r3 axis to MOTIVATE_CRC_DEVELOPMENT and may offer
