AB background : ESSENTIAL_OIL_NANOEMULSIONS have received MUCH_ATTENTION in
   THE_LAST_PERIOD due_to THEIR_ABILITY to fight MICROBES and CANCERS . in the
   CURRENT_STUDY , CLOVE_AND_THYME_ESSENTIAL_OILS_CL+TH_EMULSION and
   CL+TH_NANOEMULSION were prepared through AN_ECO_FRIENDLY_METHOD . the
   prepared CL+TH_NANOEMULSION was characterized using DLS and TEM_ANALYSES .
   results : RESULTS revealed that CL+TH_NANOEMULSION_DROPLETS were spherical
   in SHAPE and NANOFORM in SIZE ( 68.6 nm ) with PDI 0.281 .
   MIC_CONCENTRATIONS of CL+TH_NANOEMULSION against TESTED_BACTERIA were found
   to be between 6.25 and 25 MG_ML . after being EXPOSED_TO_MICS of
   CL+TH_EMULSION and CL+TH_NANOEMULSION , which additionally prompted 1.43 LOG
   and 3.12 LOG declines , accordingly , as_opposed_to untreated ( CONTROL ) ,
   THE_NUMBER of CELLS grown in THE_GENERATED_BIOFILMS decreased . furthermore
   , CL+TH_NANOEMULSION exhibited ANTICANCER_ACTIVITY more than CL+TH_EMULSION
   toward hepg2 and mcf 7 . also , THE_EFFECT of CL+TH_NANOEMULSION is more
   effective and significantly CYTOTOXIC than TAXOL on mcf 7 . besides ,
   BOTH_PREPARED_EMULSIONS increased THE_RATE of APOPTOSIS and decreased the
   CELL_VIABILITY % of mcf 7 by increasing THE_ACTIVITY of CASPASES 8 and 9 .
   moreover , CL+TH_NANO_EMULSION decreased THE_ACTIVITY of VEGFR 2 in mcf 7 in
   A_MORE_PRONOUNCED_MANNER than CL+TH_EMULSION and TAXOL . CONCLUSIONS : the
   prepared CL+TH_NANOEMULSION had ANTIBACTERIAL , and ANTIBIOFILM as_well_as

   for_this_purpose , INDEXED_ARTICLES were used , between THE_YEARS 2017 2021
   , with A_TOTAL of 80 INDEXED_ARTICLES evaluated . THE_LITERARY_ANALYSIS
   shows THE_MOST_OUTSTANDING_RESULTS including THESE_MATERIALS that , when 8 %

   in_turn , THE_FLEXURAL_STRENGTH with 10 % seashell for THE_FINE_AGGREGATE
   and 20 % RHA for THE_CEMENT , reaches A_STRENGTH of up to 65 MPA .
   in_conclusion , THE_BEHAVIOR of CONCRETE undoubtedly depends on

AB over THE_YEARS , THE_WORLD has tried to increase THE_RECYCLING of MATERIALS

   that are SUSTAINABLE and SUSTAINABLE . among_these MATERIALS , CONCRETE
   stands out as A_VERSATILE_ELEMENT , to which DIFFERENT_EXTERNAL_AGENTS can
   be added . however , since many of them are not compatible with AGGREGATES ,
   CEMENT or WATER , can CAUSE_SOME_ALTERATIONS in THEIR_MECHANICAL_PERFORMANCE
   . therefore , THE_PRESENT_INVESTIGATION addressed the study of
   AN_ARTIFICIAL_MATERIAL called MICROPOROUS_ETHYLENE_VINYL_ACETATE ( MEVA ) ,
   in_order_to EVALUATE_ITS_INFLUENCE on THE_MECHANICAL_PROPERTIES of
   STRUCTURAL_CONCRETE . MEVA_ADDITIONS were used in RANGES of 5.00 % , 10.00 %
   , 15.00 % and 20.00 % with_respect_to THE_VOLUME of CONCRETE , to analyze
   ITS_BEHAVIOR in THE_MIX , both in PHYSICAL_AND_MECHANICAL_PROPERTIES .
   THE_RESULTS show that THE_WORKABILITY and UNIT_WEIGHT are affected by
   THE_INCREASE in MEVA . despite this , THE_MECHANICAL_PERFORMANCE showed
   SIGNIFICANT_INCREASES in THE_COMPRESSIVE_STRENGTH of 8.81 % , TENSILE of

   is concluded that THE_INCORPORATION of MEVA at 5.00 % greatly improves

   THE_DRYING_TEMPERATURE of 70oc for 10 hours was suitable for producing
   WFSP_POWDER with LOW_WATER_ACTIVITY ( 0.5 ) and MOISTURE_CONTENT ( 6.5 % ) ,
   HIGH_TPC and ANTIOXIDANT_ACTIVITY , and LOW_SPECIFIC_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION .
